#!/usr/bin/env sled -f

Commentary uses 'sled' rules to strip comments from input or toggle comment-status on lines with the special marker comment-percent (eg '#%').

Blocks can be stripped with the markers comment-START / comment-END, or toggled with comment-%START / comment-%END; current comment status will be determined by the first line inside the block.

Run as part of a pipeline or use redirects:
    ...| commentary -s toggle |...
    commentary < script.lang > cleaned.lang

Note that this has no understanding of any scripting languages, it's just doing line-by-line text processing
