Context arguments available when rules are evaluated are: machine, state, input_count, input, and elements of the currently evaluating rule: label, test, action, and dest.

        Each rule consists of a label, test, action, and destination, which work as follows:

        - Label: usually a string, used for identifying the "successful" rule when tracing.

        - Test: called with context arguments; if the result is truish, the rule succeeds, no other rules are tested.

        - Action: when a test succeeds, the action is called with context arguments, including 'result' from the test above; the action's response will be included in the context arguments for the tracer and returned by this call.

        - Destination: finally, the machine will transition to the destination state unless the destination is ... (Ellipsis).

        At the end of a successful transition, the internal and any custom tracer is called with a transition format and context arguments.
