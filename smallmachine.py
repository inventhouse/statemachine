    Rules associated with the special '...' state are implicitly added to all states' rules, to be evaluated after explicit rules.

    Tracer is an optional callable that takes a tracepoint string and its associated values, and is called at critical points in the input processing to follow the internal operation of the machine.  A simple tracer can produce logs that are extremely helpful when debugging, see PrefixTracer for an example.  Tracepoints are distinct constants which can be used by more advanced tracers for selective verbosity, state management, raising errors for unrecognized input or states, and other things.  Tracer values can be collected for later use or to provide context for more sophisticated tests or actions; see ContextTracer.  Tracers can be stacked using MultiTracer.

    Public attributes can be manipulated after init; for example a rule action could set the state machine's tracer to start or stop logging of the machine's operation.

        - Label: string used for identifying the "successful" rule when tracing.

        - Test: if callable, it will be called with the input, otherwise it will be tested for equality with the input; if the result is truish, the rule succeeds and no other rules are tested.

        - Action: when a test succeeds, the action is evaluated and the response is returned by this call.  If action callable, it will be called with the input; it is common for the action to have side-effects that are intended to happen when the test is met.  If it is not callable, the action literal will be returned.

        - Destination: finally, if destination is callable it will be called with the current state to get the destination state, otherwise the literal value will be the destination.  If the destination state is '...', the machine will remain in the same state (self-transition or "loop".)  Callable destinations can implement state push/pop for recursion, state exit/enter actions, non-deterministic state changes, and other interesting things.
