A simple tracer can produce logs that are extremely helpful when debugging, see PrefixTracer for an example.

Context arguments available when rules are evaluated are: input, input_count, state, and elements of the currently evaluating rule: label, test, action, and dest.

        Each rule consists of a label, test, action, and destination, which work as follows:

        - Label: string used for identifying the "successful" rule when tracing.

        - Test: if callable, it will be called with context arguments, otherwise it will be tested for equality with the input; if the result is truish, the rule succeeds and no other rules are tested and the result is added to the context.

        - Action: when a test succeeds, the action is evaluated and the response is added to the context and returned by this call.  If action callable, it will be called with context arguments, including 'result' from the test above; it is common for the action to have side-effects that are intended to happen when the test is met.  If it is not callable, the action literal will be the response.

        - Destination: finally, if destination is callable it will be called with context arguments, including 'result' and 'response' above, to get the destination state, otherwise the literal value will be the destination.  If the destination state is '...', the machine will remain in the same state (self-transition or "loop".)  Callable destinations can implement state push/pop for recursion, state exit/enter actions, non-deterministic state changes, and other interesting things.
